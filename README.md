# Netflix Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the **Netflix Data Analysis** project! This repository is dedicated to exploring and analyzing Netflix data to uncover trends and insights into viewership and content offerings. Using Python and Matplotlib, this project demonstrates data analysis from initial cleaning through visualization to reveal meaningful patterns and findings about Netflix's vast content library.

## Project Overview
This project aims to:
- Clean and process Netflix data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends such as popular genres, release patterns, and content consumption using Matplotlib
- Present insights that could help in understanding viewer preferences and Netflix's content strategies

## Dataset
The Netflix dataset used in this project contains columns such as:
- **Title**: The name of the show or movie
- **Genre**: Categories like Drama, Comedy, Documentary, etc.
- **Release Year**: Year the content was released
- **Duration**: Length in minutes (for movies) or number of seasons (for TV shows)
- **Country**: Origin of the content
- **Date Added**: Date when the content was added to Netflix
- **Description**: Short summary of the content

## Objectives
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, format inconsistencies, and prepare the dataset for analysis.
2. **Trend Analysis**: Explore trends across genres, release years, and country distributions.
3. **Visualization**: Create insightful charts using Matplotlib to highlight patterns in the data.

## Technologies and Libraries
- **Python**: Data analysis and manipulation
- **Pandas**: Data cleaning and manipulation
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization for trends and insights
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Documenting code and analysis

## Visualizations
The following visualizations are created in this project to illustrate key insights:
- **Genre Popularity**: Bar charts showing the distribution of content genres.
- **Yearly Release Trends**: Line charts to show how Netflixâ€™s content catalog has grown over the years.
- **Country Contribution**: Pie charts for country-based content distribution.
- **Movie vs. TV Show Count**: Bar charts comparing the volume of movies and TV shows on Netflix.
