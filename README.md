# Netflix Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the **Netflix Data Analysis** project! This repository is dedicated to exploring and analyzing Netflix data to uncover trends and insights into viewership and content offerings. Using Python and Matplotlib, this project demonstrates data analysis from initial cleaning through visualization to reveal meaningful patterns and findings about Netflix's vast content library.

## Project Overview
This project aims to:
- Clean and process Netflix data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends such as popular genres, release patterns, and content consumption using Matplotlib
- Present insights that could help in understanding viewer preferences and Netflix's content strategies

## Dataset
The Netflix dataset used in this project contains columns such as:
- **Title**: The name of the show or movie
- **Genre**: Categories like Drama, Comedy, Documentary, etc.
- **Release Year**: Year the content was released
- **Duration**: Length in minutes (for movies) or number of seasons (for TV shows)
- **Country**: Origin of the content
- **Date Added**: Date when the content was added to Netflix
- **Description**: Short summary of the content

## Objectives
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, format inconsistencies, and prepare the dataset for analysis.
2. **Trend Analysis**: Explore trends across genres, release years, and country distributions.
3. **Visualization**: Create insightful charts using Matplotlib to highlight patterns in the data.

## Technologies and Libraries
- **Python**: Data analysis and manipulation
- **Pandas**: Data cleaning and manipulation
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization for trends and insights
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Documenting code and analysis

## Visualizations
The following visualizations are created in this project to illustrate key insights:
- **Genre Popularity**: Bar charts showing the distribution of content genres.
- **Yearly Release Trends**: Line charts to show how Netflix’s content catalog has grown over the years.
- **Country Contribution**: Pie charts for country-based content distribution.
- **Movie vs. TV Show Count**: Bar charts comparing the volume of movies and TV shows on Netflix.

## Project Structure
- `Netflix_Data_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis, code, and visualizations.
- `data/`: Folder containing the Netflix dataset (ensure you have the correct dataset path if running locally).
- `README.md`: Overview of the project and setup instructions.

## Results Summary

- **Content Distribution**: Netflix's content library comprises approximately **70% movies** (over **6,000 titles**) and **30% TV shows** (over **2,500 titles**), reflecting a strong focus on film content.

- **Popular TV Shows**: The most popular TV show genre is **Kids**, with a frequency of over **200**, followed by **International Drama** at **120**, and **Crime** shows, while **Comedy** shows have a frequency of less than **100**.

- **Popular Movies**: **International Drama movies** lead with over **350 titles**, closely followed by **Documentaries**, while **Comedies** have fewer than **200 titles** in Netflix's catalog.

- **Yearly Trends**: There was a significant surge in movie releases from **1,200 to 1,450 titles** between **2018-2020**, largely driven by increased demand during the pandemic, with July identified as the peak month for new content.

- **Country Contributions**: The top countries for Netflix content include the **United States** (3,240 titles) and **India** (1,057 titles), while the bottom contributors feature **Guatemala** and **Luxembourg**, each with just **1 title**.

- **Top Directors**: The top director, **Rajiv Chilaka**, has **20 titles** on Netflix, followed by **Alastair Fothergill** and **Raúl Campos, Jan Suter**, each with **18**, illustrating a diverse range of directorial contributions to the platform.

- ## Future Enhancements
- Further analysis with Seaborn for more refined visualizations
- Add additional datasets to compare Netflix with other streaming platforms
- Incorporate machine learning models to predict popular genres or content based on historical data
